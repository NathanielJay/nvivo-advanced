## Why NVivo? 

[NVivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo-qualitative-data-analysis-software/home) is software that runs locally on researchers' computers and helps them organize and analyze non-numerical or unstructured data. 

In this advanced workshop you will be introduced to creating cases and classifying them using NVivo. Generally, you can use cases classifications to record information about your study subjects, which can be people, institutions, places, among others. Case classifications allows you to include demographic information about the 'units of analysis' in your project. This workshop is ideal for those with previous knowledge working with NVivo who want to explore more possibility using the software.
